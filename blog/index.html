Whether ideas come from customer feedback or someone in the office having a light bulb moment you’re probably receiving a stream of feature-suggestions that are worth considering. But what to do with them? There are many good answers to that, but capturing them as stories in your backlog <em>isn’t</em> one of them.</p></div><a href="/blog/2017/dont-put-it-on-the-backlog/" class="read-more has-excerpt">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article data-datetime='"2017-03-19T13:02:43.000Z"' class="post-block"><div class="info"><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2017/office-as-code/" target="_self" class="link">Office as Code</a></h1><div class="date">Mar 19, 2017</div><div title="Pre-release alpha" class="post-state alpha">Alpha</div></div><div class="content has-excerpt"><p>Once upon a time developers would finish code and just chuck it over the wall to operations, relying on them to deploy and maintain the system.

Think of all the office-processes that shape the environment we work in, they drive how efficient and happy we are in our daily work but I’ve often found them difficult to change.

You know how you create a folder, fill it with code, and want to share it with others? Or maybe it’s a library to pull into your application as a dependency, instead of making one huge monolithic product? Python has <code>virtualenv</code> and <code>pip</code> for this, <code>virtualenv</code> for creating isolated environments and <code>pip</code> for downloading and managing dependencies. But they are not easy to learn, nor easy to use daily, and I dream of a better alternative.</p></div><a href="/blog/2016/the-trouble-with-python-packaging/" class="read-more has-excerpt">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article data-datetime='"2016-12-08T23:17:21.000Z"' class="post-block"><div class="info"><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2016/end-to-end-testing-with-webdriverio-sauce-labs/" target="_self" class="link">End-to-end Testing with WebdriverIO + Sauce Labs</a></h1><div class="date">Dec 8, 2016</div><div title="Pre-release alpha" class="post-state alpha">Alpha</div></div><div class="content has-excerpt"><p>After writing an article on <a href="/blog/2016/selenium-testing-with-ruby-javascript-and-python/">Selenium testing with Ruby, JS, and Python</a> I needed to make it available somewhere, and decided to host it from my own site.
