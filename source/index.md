<greeting>Hello,</greeting>

Software quality is important,
that's why I write code with an eye on testability
and sustainability  to ensure my solutions are maintainable.
My specialities are internal tools development  and workflow optimisations,
but I also love  APIs, front-end, UX, video games,
and good discussions.
